4. numpy.
5. matplotlib.
6. seaborn.

# 2. Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project For this project, I am  in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
# a)Business Understanding:
We investigated a software developer for North America was a better place to immigrate rather then Europe .
what is important to a person searching for a new job, things such as salary, salary growth, and satisfaction in what they do are important factors that determine which location is a better choice for this we need to understand

1.  Which location has the highest salary?
2.  which location has the highest career satisfaction?
3.  Which location has the highest salary growth?

# b)Prepare data:
The data comes from the stack overflow 2017 survey.It contains data that comes as numerical, categorical and text. It has missing values and outliers as well.the rows are the different respondants to the survey, and the columns are the answer to the survey questions. .

# c) Build Model:
I graphed different behaviours that were relevant to the above three questions, with the python libraries matplotlib and seaborn.

# d)Results Analysis
for the above three questions the  anserwing following conclusions:

1. Which location has the highest salary? North America
2. which location has the highest career satisfaction? THey start the same in the first year of work, but then Europe has a drop in   satisfaction of which never truly recovers until 20 years later.
3. Which location has the highest salary growth? Both follow a similar pattern
